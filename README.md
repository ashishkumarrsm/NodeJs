## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, enabling the development of scalable network applications. This repository serves as a chronicle of my journey to mastering Node.js.

## Getting Started

To get started with Node.js, you'll need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Follow the official installation guide for your operating system:

- [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once installed, verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
``

** Basic Concepts
1. Hello World: The classic starting point for any programming language.

  console.log('Hello, World!');

2. Modules and require(): Understanding how to use modules and the 'require()' function.

  const fs = require('fs');

3. File System (fs) Module: Reading and writing files using the 'fs' module.

   const fs = require('fs');
      fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) throw err;
           console.log(data);
    });

4. HTTP Module: Creating a simple web server.

        const http = require('http');
           const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
           res.statusCode = 200;
           res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
           res.end('Hello, World!\n');
        });
        server.listen(3000, () => {
           console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
        });
